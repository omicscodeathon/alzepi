Mapping the Epigenomic Landscape in Alzheimer's Disease

Abstract 
Aging and sex are pivotal factors influencing the onset and progression of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Women are nearly twice as likely as men to develop AD and face more severe neuropathological burdens and cognitive declines, despite having a longer lifespan with the disease. The underlying mechanisms of how sex differences in biological aging contribute to AD pathogenesis are not well understood. This study explores the hypothesis that sex-specific molecular signatures in AD can provide insights into therapeutic and biomarker development. We conducted a longitudinal study using 3xTg-AD mice and B6129 control mice, collecting brain samples from aged male and female mice over their lifespans. RNA sequencing was performed to analyze gene expression profiles in bulk brain tissue, focusing on differences across sexes and age groups. Our results indicate that male 3xTg-AD mice show a significant increase in immune-related gene expression compared to females, with notable activation in complement system genes. This suggests distinct inflammatory pathways between sexes in AD progression. Additionally, chronic inflammation and complement activation were linked to higher mortality rates, emphasizing that age-related immune responses play a crucial role in sex differences observed in AD. These findings underscore the need for sex-specific approaches in AD research and treatment strategies.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that is primarily characterized by progressive cognitive decline, accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Among the various factors influencing the risk and progression of AD, age and sex are two of the most significant. Aging is the most well-established risk factor for AD, with the majority of cases occurring in individuals aged 65 and older (Jagust & Landau, 2021)​(NEUROLOGY2020122069)​. Additionally, epidemiological studies have consistently shown that women are disproportionately affected by AD, exhibiting a higher prevalence and more severe cognitive decline compared to men (Awad, 2024)​(nihms-1509907)​.
The biological underpinnings of these sex differences in AD are not fully understood, but several hypotheses have been proposed. For instance, women tend to live longer than men, thereby increasing their cumulative exposure to risk factors for AD. Hormonal differences, particularly the decline in estrogen levels post-menopause, have also been implicated in the increased vulnerability of women to AD (Price & Morris, 1999; Zhao et al., 2017)​(NEUROLOGY2020122069)​​(nihms-1509907)​. Furthermore, sex-specific genetic and molecular mechanisms may play a role in modulating the response to amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation (Cacciottolo et al., 2022; Oveisgharan et al., 2019)​(nihms-1680875)​​(nihms863796)​.
Recent studies using animal models, such as the 3xTg-AD mice, have provided valuable insights into the interplay between age, sex, and AD pathology. These models have shown that aging exacerbates the accumulation of Aβ plaques and tau tangles, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits (Cells, 2024)​(nihms-1680875)​. Moreover, sex differences in the expression of genes related to immune response and inflammation have been observed, suggesting that the innate immune system may differentially contribute to AD pathogenesis in males and females (Awad, 2024; Jagust & Landau, 2021)​(nihms-1509907)​​(NEUROLOGY2020122069)​.
This study aims to investigate the sex-specific molecular and inflammatory responses in aged 3xTg-AD mice, a well-established model of AD, and to compare these findings with postmortem human brain data. By employing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile gene expression in bulk brain tissues from male and female mice at different ages, we seek to elucidate the differential impact of aging and sex on AD progression. Our hypothesis is that sex-specific molecular signatures can provide deeper insights into the mechanisms driving AD and identify potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for early intervention.
