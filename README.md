Mapping the Epigenomic Landscape in Alzheimer's Disease
Abstract 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play a pivotal role in the pathology of AD, particularly through their response to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques. This study aims to elucidate the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of human microglia influenced by different APOE isoforms (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4) and APOE knockout (APOE-KO) in a xenotransplantation model of AD. Using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we mapped gene expression profiles and chromatin accessibility in microglia isolated from xenotransplanted human microglia into AppNL-G-F mouse brains. Our findings reveal significant isoform-dependent differences in gene regulation and chromatin landscapes, contributing to a deeper understanding of APOE's role in AD pathology.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. As populations age, the incidence of AD is increasing, making it a critical focus of medical research. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, with its three common isoforms—APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4—having different impacts on the disease. APOE4, in particular, is associated with a higher risk and earlier onset of AD compared to APOE2 and APOE3, which are considered neutral or protective​(0242527)​.
Microglia, the primary immune cells in the brain, are essential in responding to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, a hallmark of AD. These cells undergo significant changes in gene expression and chromatin structure in the presence of different APOE isoforms, influencing their function and potentially contributing to AD pathology​(0242527)​. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms by which APOE isoforms affect microglial function and AD progression remain poorly understood​(0242527)​.
Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, have enabled comprehensive profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. These techniques provide valuable insights into the regulatory landscapes that govern cellular functions and disease mechanisms​(0242527)​. This study aims to elucidate the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of human microglia expressing different APOE isoforms (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4) and APOE knockout (APOE-KO) in a xenotransplantation model of AD. By integrating RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, we seek to uncover the gene regulatory mechanisms modulated by APOE in the context of AD.

Insert introduction here. This section should provide context as to why the software tool was developed and what needs it addresses. It’s also good if the need became obvious as a result of reading some literature and finding some gaps that exist in previous work in this field (citation). The background of the work should be documented here (citation) and it should be clear that the authors know the domain quite well (citation).
