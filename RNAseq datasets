Title: Age, Sex and Alzheimer’s disease: a longitudinal study of 3xTg-AD mice reveals sex-specific disease trajectories and inflammatory responses mirrored in postmortem brains from Alzheimer’s patients
Organism: Mus musculus (Mouse)
Experiment Type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
Summary:
Aging and sex are major risk factors for developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Women are nearly twice as likely as men to develop AD and suffer from a heavier neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease.
The study hypothesizes that differences in biological aging between sexes contribute to distinct molecular signatures in AD, which can be utilized for therapeutic and biomarker development.
Aged male and female 3xTg-AD mice and B6129 control mice were studied across their lifespans. Brain samples were collected longitudinally.
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed on bulk brain tissues to identify differentially expressed genes between 3xTg-AD and B6129 samples across different ages and sexes.
Results showed that male 3xTg-AD mice experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related genes in the brain compared to females, especially genes involved in the complement system, suggesting distinct inflammatory disease trajectories between sexes.
Chronic inflammation and complement activation were linked to increased mortality, revealing that age-related changes in immune response are a primary driver of sex differences in AD trajectories.
Overall Design
To examine molecular changes throughout disease progression, brain tissue from male and female 3xTg-AD and B6129 control mice were collected at the ages of 6 and 24 months.
Preparation and Analysis
Sample Collection:

Brain tissues were collected from male and female 3xTg-AD and B6129 control mice at two age points: 6 months and 24 months.
RNA Extraction and Sequencing:

Total RNA was extracted using a standardized protocol .
RNA quality and quantity were assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer.
RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit.
Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform to generate high-throughput sequencing data.
Data Processing:

Raw sequencing reads were subjected to quality control using FastQC.
Reads were trimmed to remove adaptors and low-quality bases using Trimmomatic.
Cleaned reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38) using HISAT2.
Quantification and Differential Expression Analysis:

Aligned reads were quantified using FeatureCounts to obtain gene-level count data.
Differential expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2 in R, with an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 to identify significant changes in gene expression.
Functional Enrichment Analysis:

Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to identify biological processes and pathways that are significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes.
Visualization and Interpretation:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and heatmaps were generated to visualize the overall patterns of gene expression and the differences between groups.
Specific genes related to immune response and complement activation were highlighted to understand their roles in sex-specific AD progression.
