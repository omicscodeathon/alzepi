Materials
Experimental Subjects:
Transgenic Mice: 3xTg-AD mice.
Control Mice: B6129 control mice.
Ages Studied: 6 months and 24 months.
Sexes Studied: Male and female.
Samples:
Brain tissue collected from both male and female mice.
Methods
Sample Collection
Mice were euthanized at specific time points (6 and 24 months).
Brains were immediately dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Samples were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction.
RNA Extraction
Reagent: Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent.
Kit: RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Assessment: RNA quality and quantity were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
Library Preparation and Sequencing
Library Preparation: Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina.
Sequencing Platform: Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.
Read Length: Paired-end 150 base pairs (PE150).
Data Processing
Quality Control
Tool: FastQC v0.11.9 was used to assess the quality of raw sequencing reads.
Trimming: Adapter sequences and low-quality bases were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.39.
Alignment
Reference Genome: Mouse reference genome (GRCm38/mm10).
Tool: HISAT2 v2.2.1 was used for aligning the trimmed reads to the reference genome.
Quantification
Tool: FeatureCounts v2.0.1 was used to quantify gene expression levels from the aligned reads.
Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Tool: DESeq2 v1.30.1 (R/Bioconductor package) will be used for identifying differentially expressed genes.
Adjustment for Multiple Testing: Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to control the false discovery rate (FDR).
Analysis of Correlation Between Age, Sex, and AD
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Summarize and visualize gene expression data across different groups (age, sex, AD, and control) using box plots, violin plots, and heatmaps.
Correlation Analysis:
Use Spearman’s rank correlation or Pearson correlation to analyze the correlation between gene expression levels and age, sex, and AD status.
Perform correlation analysis using R or Python packages like cor function in R or pandas and scipy in Python.
Statistical Tests:
Perform ANOVA using the aov function in R or statsmodels in Python.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Data Normalization:
Normalize gene expression data using DESeq2 or edgeR to account for sequencing depth and other technical variations.
PCA Analysis:
Perform PCA using the normalized gene expression data to reduce dimensionality and identify major sources of variation.
Use R packages like prcomp or Python libraries like scikit-learn to perform PCA.
Visualize PCA results using scatter plots to distinguish between different groups (age, sex, AD, and control).
Comparing Controls and Diseased Samples
Differential Expression Analysis:
Use DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes between 3xTg-AD and B6129 control mice at each age and sex.
Adjust p-values for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
Volcano Plot:
Create volcano plots to visualize differentially expressed genes with log fold change on the x-axis and -log10(p-value) on the y-axis.
Heatmap:
Generate heatmaps of differentially expressed genes to visualize expression patterns across samples using pheatmap in R or seaborn in Python.
Functional Enrichment Analysis:
Perform Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes using tools like DAVID or Enrichr.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA):
Conduct GSEA to identify enriched pathways and biological processes in AD versus control groups using the GSEA software.
